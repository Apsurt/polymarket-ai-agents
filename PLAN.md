# Polymarket AI Trading Agents - Comprehensive Implementation Plan

## System Architecture Overview

**Tech Stack:**
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Message Queue**: Redis with RQ
- **Caching**: Redis for data + Anthropic prompt caching
- **LLMs**: Local models (Ollama) for dev, API models for production
- **Containerization**: Docker for development environment

## Phase 1: Data Collection Infrastructure (Weeks 1-2)

### 1.1 Core Data Pipeline
```
Data Sources → Message Queue → Validation → Database → Cache Layer
```

### 1.2 Microservices Architecture
Each collector runs as independent service with shared base class:

**Base Collector (`collectors/base.py`)**
```python
class BaseCollector:
    - Error handling & retry logic
    - Rate limiting compliance
    - Data standardization format
    - Queue publishing interface
    - Health check endpoints
```

**Individual Collectors:**
1. **NewsCollector** (`collectors/news.py`)
   - RSS feeds (Reuters, AP, Bloomberg)
   - News API integration
   - Deduplication logic
   - Relevance filtering

2. **SocialCollector** (`collectors/social.py`)
   - Reddit API (r/politics, r/sportsbook, r/weather, r/worldnews)
   - Twitter API basic tier
   - Sentiment preprocessing
   - Spam/bot detection

3. **MarketCollector** (`collectors/market.py`)
   - Polymarket API (prices, volumes, new markets)
   - Competitor odds scraping
   - Historical data backfill
   - Market metadata tracking

4. **EventCollector** (`collectors/events.py`)

6. **BreakingNewsMonitor** (`collectors/breaking.py`)
   - Runs every 5 minutes
   - Uses cheap LLM (GPT-3.5-turbo) to flag urgent events
   - Triggers immediate analysis pipeline

### 1.3 Database Schema (Supabase)
```sql
-- Raw data storage
CREATE TABLE raw_data_events (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    source VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    event_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    category VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- political, sports, economic, misc
    content JSONB NOT NULL,
    metadata JSONB,
    relevance_score FLOAT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    processed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);

-- Processed market data
CREATE TABLE market_snapshots (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    market_id VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    category VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(10,6),
    volume BIGINT,
    market_data JSONB,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Data source reliability tracking
CREATE TABLE source_reliability (
    source VARCHAR(50),
    category VARCHAR(50),
    total_events INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    successful_predictions INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    accuracy_score DECIMAL(5,4),
    last_updated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    PRIMARY KEY (source, category)
);

-- Breaking events queue
CREATE TABLE breaking_events (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    category VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    event_data JSONB NOT NULL,
    urgency_score INTEGER,
    processed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 1.4 Message Queue System
```python
# Queue structure
QUEUES = {
    'data.raw': 'Raw data ingestion',
    'data.validation': 'Data cleaning and validation',
    'data.breaking': 'Urgent events for immediate processing',
    'analysis.political': 'Political market analysis',
